<h2>What are Succulents?</h2>
<p>Succulents are a diverse group of plants known for their ability to store water in their leaves, stems, or roots. This adaptation allows them to thrive in arid climates and soil conditions. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, making them popular choices for both indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>

<h2>Care Tips for Succulents</h2>
<p>Succulents are relatively low-maintenance, but they do require some specific care:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Light:</strong> Most succulents prefer bright, indirect sunlight. Too much direct sun can cause sunburn, while too little can lead to stretching.</li>

<li><strong>Water:</strong> Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is a common mistake that can lead to root rot.</li>

<li><strong>Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining soil mix, often labeled as cactus or succulent soil, to prevent water from sitting around the roots.</li>

<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Succulents generally prefer warmer temperatures and should be protected from frost.</li>
</ul>
